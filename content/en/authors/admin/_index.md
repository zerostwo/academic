My name is Songqi Duan and I love mathematics and computer science. I plan to become a researcher in the future, and I am still an undergraduate (entered in September 2017). profession. After entering university, I discovered the direction of bioinformatics. When I saw her at first glance, I knew that I could not leave her in the future. As the saying goes, a bioinformatics learner who canâ€™t program is not a good food man, so I started my long self-study in bioinformatics.

I have seen a sentence: The so-called university is actually a place to exercise your self-study ability. This is indeed the case. Perhaps after graduation, the place where professional knowledge is available is limited, but the self-study ability exercised through the four years of undergraduate will allow you to show your skills anywhere. I admire the people who silently contributed behind the articles I saw on the Internet during my self-study. They shared what they learned to good scholars. So I want to share what I have learned with you.

My name is **Songqi Duan** and I love mathematics and computer science. I plan to become a researcher in the future, and I am still an undergraduate (entered in September 2017). After entering university, I discovered the direction of bioinformatics. When I saw her at first glance, I knew that I could not leave her in the future. As the saying goes, a bioinformatics learner who can’t program is not a good food man, so I started my long self-study in bioinformatics.

I am calm, silent, flexible, adaptable, and strongly dissatisfied with the status quo. For anything of interest, I must explore a reasonable explanation. Like theory and abstract things, like conceptual thinking, but not social. In the area of ​​interest, I have the extraordinary ability to focus and solve problems in depth. Have a skeptical spirit, sometimes like to criticize, often good at analysis.

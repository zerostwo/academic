# Abstract.
abstract = "As a new processing technology, 3D printing is able to realize the personalized customization of food appearance and formula, and further improve the consumer's experience of functional food. Based on this, this paper developed a printable Aloe vera gel-potato starch gel matrix and loaded different types and additions of food colloids into the gel matrix. The effects of κ-carrageenan gum (κC), gum arabic (GA), sodium alginate (SA), pullulan (PUL), polydextrose (PD), β- cyclodextrin (β-CD) on rheological properties, texture characteristics and microstructure were explored respectively. The printing effect and deviation of different samples were investigated, and the stability of printed samples was also evaluated. The results showed that the 3D printed product with 1.3% κC has the highest accuracy, the most compact microstructure, the best chewing performance."

# Abstract.
abstract = "**[Objective]** In order to solve the serious waste of fruit resources， but also provide new resources for agricultural develop-ment and make mango waste can be fully resourced.**[Method]** A strain L-1 with the ability to efficiently degrade cellulose was selected from the mango waste by selected medium. The optimal conditions of cellulose degradation rate and saccharification rate in mango waste under the joint action of Ligninolytic bacteria (MF687854) are determined by single factor and orthogonal experiments. At the same time， we analyzed the protein content and amino acid composition of the fermentation products. **[Result]** Strain morphology characterization and ITS rDNA se-quence analysis is identified as Trichoderma reesei (MK257811). The optimal fermentation conditions: mixed bacterium (Cellulose degrading bacteria: Ligninolytic bacteria) ratio is 3:2， inoculation amount is 12.5 g/100 g， the water content is 70%， initial pH value was 6.0， and the optimum temperature was 26℃.**[Conclusion]** Mixed bacteria fermentation has extremely high feasibility and degradability. Trichoderma reesei significantly improved the degradation ability of mango waste and balance the amino acid composition of the fermentation substrate when it interacts with Lentinus edodes."
